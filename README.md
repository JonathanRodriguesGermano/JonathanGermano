<h2> 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me </h2>

I am a Full Stack Developer and CS Student currently optimizing public sector workflows. I build scalable solutions using TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, while driving operational efficiency through interactive dashboards and Power Automate workflows.    

I wrote my first lines of code at age 17 with a simple goal: to create a page as a birthday gift for someone special. After hours of research and trial and error, seeing that finished page was magical.
That unique moment. I realized that, with code, I had the power to build anything I could imagine. And that's when I understood: I wanted to be a developer.

Since then, I’ve remained deeply passionate about programming and constantly strive to learn more and become a better professional every day.

<h2> 🎓 &nbsp;Lifelong Learner & Knowledge Sharer </h2

One of my greatest passions is continuous learning and knowledge sharing. Beyond just writing code, I am fascinated by the impact of sharing what I know. I have discovered that teaching is the best way to learn: explaining concepts makes me a sharper developer and a more empathetic team player. I constantly strive to be a better professional by supporting those around me.

Exchanging knowledge helps me grow just as much as writing code, and I constantly strive to be a better developer and human being.
